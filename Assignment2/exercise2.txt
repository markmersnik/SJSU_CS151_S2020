The difference between primitive data type int and class Integer is found in their usage. The primitive data type int simply holds a value but does not offer any other functionality. However, the class Integer has the same numerical storage capability but with a lot of added features. It includes fields such as MAX_VALUE, MIN_VALUE, SIZE, and TYPE. It also comes with a constructor that can take either an primitive int or string as the parameter. Lastly, and probably most usefully, the Integer class contains a wide variety of methods that can describe and alter Integer and int related variables. Although, it should be mentioned that the Integer class is a lot slower and takes up more space than the int primitive data type. Therefore, if one does not need all of the additional functionality, the primitive int data type should be used.
